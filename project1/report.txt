[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] for your answer
	[] crashes when?
	[] infinite loop when it should not?
	[] only works in printed mode?
	[X] work fine?
	[] only implemented these options: [please list them]
	[] other? Explain.


How does your move strategy work? Describe briefly in English.
The move strategy is implemented as wanted by the instructions. It loops through
and finds a valid spot for the current agent to move to if their happiness falls
below the strength of preference. It'll swap those two and make the previous vacant
spot unavailable for the rest of the cycle for other agents. 



============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?
What I found most revealing was just how helpful knowing how to debug code
can be. I knew this before hand, but the debugger really came in handy. It also
really messed me up when I was testing the code as the matrices are built 
different than when running the code normally. It was still more help than it
was harm for me.


============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?
What I learned was how to use matrices effectively and how to manipulate them,
even when they are filled where characters.


What was easy about this assignment?
What I found easy was the initial grasping of the project. I knew where the calculations
would be going, and the basis of how they would be done, I started to understand more 
on how the agents will move, and I understood how the structure of the lab should look.


What gave you problems or troubles?
As stated previously, running the debugger did not help me, and it made me run into more troubles 
when trying to fix my algorithm. I did eventually get them fixed, but it took me longer than I 
was anticipating.


What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?
To improve this assignment, maybe give a brief lecture on how to use the curses mode, or some
more documentation. I went searching for it and found the right documents, but it was still
annoying to deal with learning how to print that while also making sure the rest of the code
printed fine.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
I did like the learning curve of this project. I felt that the more that I got into it, the 
more difficult it got, but I was also learning new tricks while doing the lab and updating my
code as I went along to be more efficient.
