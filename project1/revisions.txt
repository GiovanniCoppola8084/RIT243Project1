    Ignore the last push. The switch statement now allows both cases to work in which the command is missing a value, or if the command is unknown.

    Switch statement fixed for getopt. The cases for when there is an incomplete arg and invalid arg were swapped around to make it correct.

    Case for when the user enters h for a command line arg has been updated to stop the program, and to not continue running the algroithm.

    Final changes and comments were added. One statement was missing from the optarg switch (when there was an unknown arg used), and some of the formatting needed to be changed for other optarg statements. Also, the for loop that runs the finite mode print was changed so that it can print out the zero cycle when -c0 is used. Try was run and it looks accurate. The matrices don't exactly match up, but the rest of the data is either the same, or accurate for the matrix that I have for my code.

    The algroithm finally works in finding the neighbors for the agents. The only thing left to change is the printing of the cycle, the moves, and the team happiness.

    Case added where the command line argument is incomplete.

    The function to determine the happiness of an agent was changed in order to use the value of the agent as a parameter. The function to find the happiness was also changed to only use nested for loops (minimal code). The main was also changed to pass in a different parameter to the print functions for the happiness level. Changes were also made to function comments, and the header doc was added to the file.

    The rest of the main function was completed so that it will run cycles in either the curses, or non curses mode, as many times as the user specifies. Testing was not done just yet

    The switch statement order was changed to fit that of the order that it is passed into the command line arguments from. Also, some of the functionality of the switch was added. There are still some errors checks that need to be added. Finally, some other code was changed after the switch statement.

    Functions were changed in order to use a matrix, and not a grid. This is to reduce the lines of code and amount of processing needed to run the program.
